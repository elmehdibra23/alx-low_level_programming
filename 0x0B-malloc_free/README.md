0x0B. C - malloc, free
C project on Memory allocation
Concepts: malloc, free, automatic/dynamic allocation.
Requirements: C89, 5 functions per file, no global vars, no other std lib functions besides malloc and free.

Tasks
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
The woman who has no imagination has no wings
He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
It's not bragging if you can back it up
